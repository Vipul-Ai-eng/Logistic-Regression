# Logistic Regression step by step process
1.Compute a weighted sum of input features with an added bias term.

2.Apply a sigmoid activation to obtain a probability estimate.

3.Compute gradients of the loss with respect to model parameters.

4.Update weights and bias using gradient descent approach.

5.Generate class predictions using a fixed probability threshold.
